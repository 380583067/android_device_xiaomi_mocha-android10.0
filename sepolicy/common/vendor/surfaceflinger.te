# The objective here is to allow surfaceflinger r/w/c access
# /mnt/tmp/fc[0-9] files.
#
# I first give surfaceflinger r/w/c to 'tmpfs' and
# 'surfaceflinger_tmpfs': I don't know _exactly_ how those two are
# related (I suppose 'surfaceflinger_tmpfs' is subset of 'tmpfs'
# because the first line is also required).
#
# Then, further, I also give permissions to the /mnt/tmp/fc<N> nodes
# explicitly (r/w/c to surfaceflinger and r to nvphsd) which may not be
# strictly needed after the first two but seems to be in line with how
# sepolicies are written, i.e. come up with as many contexts and
# domains and types as you can think of to model your usage patterns.
